MilkDrop 3 can run on Linux with Wine.

The limited information I have:
It just needs the Protontricks prefixes for Fallout 4.
Same thing to run MilkDrop's DirectX and VC Redist package.

Download:
https://github.com/milkdrop2077/MilkDrop3/releases/download/MilkDrop3/MilkDrop3.exe
Launch the program and extract all the files.

Replace MilkDrop 3.31\MilkDrop 3.exe with the "MilkDrop 3 Linux.exe" version from this folder.

Know bugs:
The text in the F1 message and the menus when pressing 'L' or 'M' is glitchy.


If you have the time, please write a short tutorial on how to run MilkDrop 3 on Linux.
I will send you a present!
